            "    \"bodyText\": \"US Customs and Border Protection implemented a rule this week that will require airlines to disregard \\u201cX\\u201d sex markers on passports and input an \\u201cM\\u201d or \\u201cF\\u201d marker instead, sending those people with an \\u201cX\\u201d marker into panic. \\u201cX\\u201d markers became available to US passport holders in 2022, in an effort to allow people with gender identities other than male and female to obtain more accurate travel documents. Now, the new CBP rule has many people on social media and beyond worried that they will no longer be allowed to fly internationally. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit too soon to say how this is going to practically work out,\\u201d said Andy Izenson, senior legal director at the Chosen Family Law Center. Passports with \\u201cX\\u201d markers should still be considered valid travel documents; the US district court of Massachusetts issued an order in June ensuring that they would remain valid after the Trump administration attempted to ban them under executive order 14168, titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. While the courts have continued to prevent the Trump administration from outright banning a third gender marker, this week\\u2019s rule can still serve to make the lives of trans and non-binary people more difficult, Izenson says. \\u201cI would suggest the intent is to ensure that any individual person who\\u2019s acting under color of law or as an agent of the state has as much leeway to act out their personal bigotry as they want, without any concern about consequences,\\u201d Izenson said. After spending time on the phone with CBP, the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, Izenson was unable to get clear answers about how the rule would function, and who would be responsible for enforcing it. Izenson said it\\u2019s questionable whether it will be up to individual agents whether they choose to flag \\u201cX\\u201d gender markers on passports that are different from the \\u201cF\\u201d and \\u201cM\\u201d markers that airlines will now be required to input, or whether the rule could prevent travelers with \\u201cX\\u201d markers from boarding international flights. Land border crossings and domestic flights should not be affected, however, per Izenson. A CBP spokesperson said: \\u201cForeign travelers with authorized and valid US travel documents are being processed as they were previously. New or renewing Trusted Traveler Program applicants are now required to choose one of the two approved designations, male or female, to complete the application. An applicant\\u2019s choice of sex is not criteria for an applicant\\u2019s admission into the US.\\u201d Izenson and Carl Charles, counsel for Lambda Legal, both say they have not yet heard about the rule causing problems for people at the airport. But Dr July Pilowsky, a scientist and US citizen currently residing in Spain who uses he/they/she pronouns, said the new rule is already disrupting their life. When Pilowsky initially chose to change their passport gender marker to \\u201cX\\u201d, they said \\u201cit was a practical decision\\u201d. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like I did it to validate myself and feel good about myself,\\u201d Pilowsky said, noting they did it out of necessity because it can be a bureaucratic hassle when different identity documents have different information on them. Additionally, Pilowsky said they\\u2019d already experienced trouble at the airport because of their gender expression. \\u201cWhat CBP officers do when you show them your document [passport] at the border, is they look at the sex marker on your document. And based on what that sex marker says, they decide what you\\u2019re supposed to look like and what your body is supposed to be like,\\u201d Pilowsky said. Body-scanning X-rays at airport security that reveal genitalia can be especially invasive for trans people. \\u201cThe CBP officers can decide whether the results of the body scan are suspicious or not, based on, you know, there\\u2019s something in your pants they think you shouldn\\u2019t have. So what\\u2019s on your document shapes what CBP officers believe ought to be reality,\\u201d they continued. Pilowsky said they\\u2019ve experienced \\u201cinvasive pat-downs\\u201d because of this, which is one reason why they decided to get the \\u201cX\\u201d marker. \\u201cWhat I wanted to do was disrupt the process. When you have a sex marker that says \\u2018X\\u2019, then suddenly it\\u2019s difficult for the CBP officer to build an image of what you\\u2019re supposed to look like and compare you against it, positively or negatively,\\u201d they explained. Now that the new rule has been implemented, they have to worry about the same problem again. \\u201cI\\u2019ve experienced some slice of the spectrum of things you can experience if you\\u2019re under suspicion,\\u201d they said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to know about the rest of that spectrum.\\u201d To avoid this, Pilowsky said, \\u201cI\\u2019m being forced into the rather absurd situation of reaching out to an immigration lawyer in order to enter my own country.\\u201d They have dual citizenship in the US and Chile, so they\\u2019re hoping to enter the US with a Chilean passport, which doesn\\u2019t have an \\u201cX\\u201d marker option, in the future. Charles of Lambda Legal said he still considers the availability of \\u201cX\\u201d markers a victory. \\u201cPeople need identity documents to navigate their everyday lives,\\u201d he said. Future legal challenges to the policy will depend on how it winds up being implemented, Izenson said, adding that they expect the policy will shake out differently for different people depending on what airline passengers choose, and other elements of their identity. \\u201cThat question depends on a person\\u2019s experience and identity and how they move through the world on a number of levels, including what gender they are perceived as, what their body looks like, what their skin tone is, how they\\u2019re dressed,\\u201d Izenson said. Izenson thinks that the intention of the policy has little to do with passports and airports, saying: \\u201cThey are trying to throw us into a state of reactivity so that we\\u2019re not able to focus on practical advocacy and the material needs of our communities. The more they can keep us confused and freaked out and not sure what\\u2019s going on, the more they can do whatever they want.\\u201d\"\n",

Deng Chol Majek, who claims to be 19, was \\u201cclearly excited about what he had done\\u201d after inflicting fatal wounds on Rhiannon Skye Whyte, who worked in the hotel where he was living, Wolverhampton crown court heard. The Sudanese national followed Whyte, who had only worked at the Park Inn hotel for three months, to the Bescot Stadium railway station in Walsall on 20 October last year, the jury was told. Whyte, whose shift had finished at 11pm, was heard screaming during a phone call to a friend and was found by a train guard on the platform minutes later, the prosecutor, Michelle Heeley KC, told the court. Opening the case against Majek, Heeley told the court he followed the 27-year-old from the hotel where he was living. She said: \\u201cHe followed her down on to the train platform at the Bescot Stadium station and then he attacked her. Stabbing her over and over again with a screwdriver. \\u201cHe left her bleeding to death and then casually went back to his hotel. We say you can be sure he is guilty of murder.\\u201d The court heard how police were able to identify Majek because of the clothing he wore during the attack, and that he was found to have Whyte\\u2019s DNA under his fingernails, which the prosecution said was caused by the victim attempting to defend herself. \\u201cThe police were able to review the CCTV very quickly and they could see the defendant in his distinctive clothing,\\u201d Heeley said. \\u201cWhen they went to the hotel they found him and his clothes. They seized a number of items, including the jacket the attacker from the CCTV could be seen wearing. \\u201cThey recovered some jewellery and a pair of sandals. The jacket, a ring and the sandals had Rhiannon Whyte\\u2019s blood on them. \\u201cThere was a lot of blood because of the vicious nature of this attack. Rhiannon had been stabbed, in total, 23 times. Most of the stab injuries were to her head, but some were to the left side of her chest and left arm, indicating she had tried to fend off her attacker. \\u201cEleven of the stab wounds had penetrated her skull; one in particular had damaged the brain stem, which is what ultimately caused the death. The defendant\\u2019s fingernails were checked, he had DNA under them \\u2013 the DNA belonged to Rhiannon Whyte.\\u201d It was not initially clear what motivated the attack, though earlier in the evening he had allegedly been seen staring at the victim and a co-worker. Heeley said: \\u201cNo one could recall any particular issue that would have caused him to act in that way. \\u201cWhat is clear from the CCTV is that the defendant was hanging around the reception area, staring at Rhiannon throughout the evening.\\u201d Majek denies charges of murder and possessing an offensive weapon. The trial continues.\",\n          \"Gavin Newsom vetoed a California bill that was set to ban the sale of cookware and other consumer goods manufactured with Pfas, also known as \\u201cforever chemicals\\u201d, human-made compounds linked to a range of health issues. The governor\\u2019s decision on Monday followed months of debate and advocacy, including from high-profile celebrity chefs such as Thomas Keller and Rachael Ray, who argued that nonstick cookware made with Pfas, when manufactured responsibly, can be safe and effective and urged lawmakers to vote against the proposal. Newsom said in a statement that the legislation was \\u201cwell-intentioned\\u201d but would affect too broad a swath of products and would result in a \\u201csizable and rapid shift\\u201d of cooking products available in the state. \\u201cI am deeply concerned about the impact this bill would have on the availability of affordable options in cooking products,\\u201d Newsom wrote, adding that the state \\u201cmust carefully consider\\u201d the consequences of a dramatic shift in available products. Concerns over the use of Pfas, chemicals used to make cookware and other items non-stick and water-resistant, have grown significantly in recent years. Called \\u201cforever chemicals\\u201d, because they do not break down naturally, Pfas are used in non-stick cookware, waterproof mascara and dental floss, among other items. Pfas have been linked to a number of health issues, with some linked to high cholesterol, reproductive issues and cancer. A United States Geological Survey study in 2023 detected the chemicals in almost half the country\\u2019s tap water. Under the bill approved by California\\u2019s legislature, the state by 2030 would have banned the sale or distribution of goods, including cleaning products, cookware, floss, food packaging and ski wax, with \\u201cintentionally added\\u201d Pfas. The bill had the support of major environmental groups, as well as opposition from influential figures, such as Ray and Keller, and high-profile chefs who argued it would place an unfair burden on restaurants. Ray argued the focus should be on educating consumers rather than eliminating the products. \\u201cRemoving access to these products without providing fact-based context could hurt the very people we\\u2019re trying to protect,\\u201d Ray said. Ben Allen, the state senator who introduced the legislation, told the Los Angeles Times he planned to keep working on the issue. \\u201cWe are obviously disappointed,\\u201d he told the newspaper. \\u201cWe know there are safer alternatives \\u2013 [but] I understand there were strong voices on both sides on this topic.\\u201d Over the weekend, Newsom also vetoed legislation focused on racial justice, including a bill that would allowed universities to give the descendants of enslaved people preference in admissions preference, while approving funding for a reparations study. He also signed a bill allowing a wide range of family members to care for children if the federal government deports their parents.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "        Step into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab in Cambridge, US, and the future feels a little closer. Glass cabinets display prototypes of weird and wonderful creations, from tiny desktop robots to a surrealist sculpture created by an AI model prompted to design a tea set made from body parts. In the lobby, an AI waste-sorting assistant named Oscar can tell you where to put your used coffee cup. Five floors up, research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna has been working on wearable brain-computer interfaces she hopes will one day enable people who cannot speak, due to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, to communicate using their minds. Kosmyna spends a lot of her time reading and analysing people’s brain states. Another project she is working on is a wearable device – one prototype looks like a pair of glasses – that can tell when someone is getting confused or losing focus. Around two years ago, she began receiving out-of-the blue emails from strangers who reported that they had started using large language models such as ChatGPT and felt their brain had changed as a result. Their memories didn’t seem as good – was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side – were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked. And if they were using AI, how much did they even understand of the answers they were giving? With some MIT colleagues, Kosmyna set up an experiment that used an electroencephalogram to monitor people’s brain activity while they wrote essays, either with no digital assistance, or with the help of an internet search engine, or ChatGPT. She found that the more external help participants had, the lower their level of brain connectivity, so those who used ChatGPT to write showed significantly less activity in the brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention and creativity. In other words, whatever the people using ChatGPT felt was going on inside their brains, the scans showed there wasn’t much happening up there. The study’s participants, who were all enrolled at MIT or nearby universities, were asked, right after they had handed in their work, if they could recall what they had written. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could give a quote,” Kosmyna says. “That was concerning, because you just wrote it and you do not remember anything.” Kosmyna is 35, trendily dressed in a blue shirt dress and a big, multicoloured necklace, and she speaks faster than most people can think. As she observes, writing an essay requires skills that are important in our wider lives: the ability to synthesise information, consider competing perspectives and construct an argument. You use these skills in everyday conversations. “How are you going to deal with that? Are you going to be, like, ‘Err … can I just check my phone?’” she says. The experiment was small (54 participants) and has not yet been peer reviewed. In June, however, Kosmyna posted it online, thinking other researchers might find it interesting, and then she went about her day, unaware that she had just created an international media frenzy. Alongside the journalist requests, she received more than 4,000 emails from around the world, many from stressed-out teachers who feel their students aren’t learning properly because they are using ChatGPT to do their homework. They worry AI is creating a generation who can produce passable work but don’t have any usable knowledge or understanding of the material. The fundamental issue, Kosmyna says, is that as soon as a technology becomes available that makes our lives easier, we’re evolutionarily primed to use it. “Our brains love shortcuts, it’s in our nature. But your brain needs friction to learn. It needs to have a challenge.” If brains need friction but also instinctively avoid it, it’s interesting that the promise of technology has been to create a “frictionless” user experience, to ensure that, provided we slide from app to app or screen to screen, we will meet no resistance. The frictionless user experience is why we unthinkingly offload ever more information and work to our digital devices; it’s why internet rabbit holes are so easy to fall down and so hard to climb out of; it’s why generative AI has already integrated itself so completely into most people’s lives. We know, from our collective experience, that once you become accustomed to the hyperefficient cybersphere, the friction-filled real world feels harder to deal with. So you avoid phone calls, use self-checkouts, order everything from an app; you reach for your phone to do the maths sum you could do in your head, to check a fact before you have to dredge it up from memory, to input your destination on Google maps and travel from A to B on autopilot. Maybe you stop reading books because maintaining that kind of focus feels like friction; maybe you dream of owning a self-driving car. Is this the dawn of what the writer and education expert Daisy Christodoulou calls a “stupidogenic society”, a parallel to an obesogenic society, in which it is easy to become stupid because machines can think for you? Human intelligence is too broad and varied to be reduced to words such as “stupid”, but there are worrying signs that all this digital convenience is costing us dearly. Across the economically developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Pisa scores, which measure 15-year-olds’ reading, maths and science, tended to peak around 2012. While over the 20th century IQ scores increased globally, perhaps due to improved access to education and better nutrition, in many developed countries they appear to have been declining. Falling test and IQ scores are the subject of hot debate. What is harder to dispute is that, with every technological advance, we deepen our dependence on digital devices and find it harder to work or remember or think or, frankly, function without them. “It’s only software developers and drug dealers who call people users,” Kosmyna mutters at one point, frustrated at AI companies’ determination to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs. In the ever-expanding, frictionless online world, you are first and foremost a user: passive, dependent. In the dawning era of AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, how will we maintain the scepticism and intellectual independence we’ll need? By the time we agree that our minds are no longer our own, that we simply cannot think clearly without tech assistance, how much of us will be left to resist? * * * Start telling people that you’re worried about what intelligent machines are doing to our brains and there’s a risk that, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will laugh at what a fuddy-duddy you were. Socrates worried that writing would weaken people’s memories and encourage only superficial understanding: not wisdom but “the conceit of wisdom” – an argument that is strikingly similar to many critiques of AI. What happened instead was that writing and the technological advances that followed – the printing press, mass media, the internet era – meant that ever more people had access to ever more information. More people could develop great ideas, and they could share those ideas more easily, and this made us cleverer and more innovative, as individuals and as communities. After all, writing didn’t only change how we access and retain information; it changed how we think. A person can achieve more complex tasks with a notebook and paper to hand than without: most people can’t work out 53,683 divided by 7 in their head but could have a stab at doing long division on paper. I couldn’t have dictated this piece, but writing helped me organise and clarify my thoughts. As humans, we’re very good at what experts call “cognitive offloading”, namely using our physical environment to reduce our mental load, and this in turn helps us achieve more complex cognitive tasks. Imagine how much harder it would be to function each day without a calendar or phone reminders, or without Google to remember everything for you. In the best case scenario, intelligent people working in partnership with intelligent machines will achieve new intellectual feats and solve tricky problems: we’re already seeing, for instance, how AI can help scientists discover new drugs faster and doctors detect cancer earlier and more efficiently. The complication is, if technology is truly making us cleverer – turning us into efficient, information-processing machines – why do we spend so much time feeling dumb? Last year, “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of the year, a term that captures both the specific feeling of mindlessness that descends when we spend too much time scrolling through rubbish online and the corrosive, aggressively dumb content itself, the nonsense memes and AI garble. When we hold our phones we have, in theory, most of the world’s accumulated knowledge at our fingertips, so why do we spend so much time dragging our eyeballs over dreck? One issue is that our digital devices have not been designed to help us think more efficiently and clearly; almost everything we encounter online has been designed to capture and monetise our attention. Each time you reach for your phone with the intention of completing a simple, discrete, potentially self-improving task, such as checking the news, your primitive hunter-gatherer brain confronts a multibillion-pound tech industry devoted to throwing you off course and holding your attention, no matter what. To extend Christodoulou ’s metaphor, in the same way that one feature of an obesogenic society are food deserts – whole neighbourhoods in which you cannot buy a healthy meal – large parts of the internet are information deserts, in which the only available brain food is junk. In the late 90s the tech consultant Linda Stone, who was working as a professor at New York University, noticed that her students were using technology very differently from her colleagues at Microsoft, where she also worked. While her Microsoft colleagues were disciplined about working on two screens – one for emails, perhaps, and another for Word, or a spreadsheet – her students seemed to be trying to do 20 things at once. She coined the term “continuous partial attention” to describe the stressful, involuntarily state we often find ourselves in when we’re trying to toggle between several cognitively demanding activities, such as responding to emails while on a Zoom call. When I first heard the term I realised that I, like most people I know, live most of my life in a state of continuous partial attention, whether I’m guiltily checking my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with my kids, or incessantly sidetracked by texts and emails when I’m trying to write, or trying to relax while watching Netflix and simultaneously doing an online food shop, still wondering why I feel as chilled-out as an over-microwaved dinner. Digital multitasking makes us feel productive, but this is often illusory. “You have a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything,” Stone tells me. It also makes you feel permanently on edge: one study she conducted found that 80% of people experience “screen apnea” when checking their emails: they become so caught up in the endless notifications that they forget to breathe properly. “Your fight or flight system becomes up-regulated, because you’re constantly trying to stay on top of things,” she says, and this hypervigilance has cognitive costs: it makes us more forgetful, worse at making decisions and less attentive. Continuous partial attention helps explain both brain rot as a mental state – because what is it if not cognitive overwhelm, the point at which you stop resisting the onslaught of digital distraction and allow your brain to rest in the internet’s warm, murky shallows? – and the existence of the online slop itself. After all, what matters to tech companies financially is not that you want to be reading what you’re reading, or that you love what you listen to or what you’re looking at, only that you are unwilling or unable to pull yourself away. This is why streaming services such as Netflix crank out bland, formulaic films that are euphemistically labelled “casual viewing” and are literally designed for viewers who aren’t really watching, and Spotify playlists are filled with generic stock music by fake artists, to provide background music, “Chill Out” or “Party” vibes, for listeners who aren’t really listening. In short, the modern internet doesn’t necessarily make you an idiot, but it definitely primes you to act like one. * * * It is into this climate that generative AI arrived, with an entirely novel offer. Until recently you could only outsource remembering and some data processing to technology; now you can outsource thinking itself. Given that we spend most of our lives feeling overstimulated and frazzled, it’s little wonder that so many have jumped at the chance to let a computer do more things we would have once done for ourselves– such as write work reports or emails, or plan a holiday. As we transition from the internet era to the AI era, what we’re consuming is not only ever more low-value, ultra-processed information, but more information that is essentially predigested, delivered in a way that is designed to bypass important human functions, such as assessing, filtering and summarising information, or actually considering a problem rather than finessing the first solution presented to us. Michael Gerlich, head of the Centre for Strategic Corporate Foresight and Sustainability at SBS Swiss Business School, began studying the impact of generative AI on critical thinking because he noticed the quality of classroom discussions decline. Sometimes he’d set his students a group exercise, and rather than talk to one another they continued to sit in silence, consulting their laptops. He spoke to other lecturers, who had noticed something similar. Gerlich recently conducted a study, involving 666 people of various ages, and found those who used AI more frequently scored lower on critical thinking. (As he notes, to date his work only provides evidence for a correlation between the two: it’s possible that people with lower critical thinking abilities are more likely to trust AI, for example.) Like many researchers, Gerlich believes that, used in the right way, AI can make us cleverer and more creative – but the way most people use it produces bland, unimaginative, factually questionable work. One concern is the so-called “anchoring effect”. If you post a question to generative AI, the answer it gives you sets your brain on a certain mental path and makes you less likely to consider alternative approaches. “I always use the example: imagine a candle. Now, AI can help you improve the candle. It will be the brightest ever, burn the longest, be very cheap and amazing looking, but it will never develop to the lightbulb,” he says. To get from the candle to a lightbulb you need a human who is good at critical thinking, someone who might take a chaotic, unstructured, unpredictable approach to problem solving. When, as has happened in many workplaces, companies roll out tools such as the chatbot Copilot without offering decent AI training, they risk producing teams of passable candle-makers in a world that demands high-efficiency lightbulbs. There is also the bigger issue that adults who use AI as a shortcut have at least benefited from going through the education system in the years before it was possible to get a computer to write your homework for you. One recent British survey found that 92% of university students use AI, and about 20% have used AI to write all or part of an assignment for them. Under these circumstances, how much are they learning? Are schools and universities still equipped to produce creative, original thinkers who will build better, more intelligent societies – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones? * * * Some years ago, Matt Miles, a psychology teacher at a high school in Virginia in the US, was sent on a training programme on tech in schools. The teachers were shown a video in which a schoolgirl is caught checking her phone during lessons. In the video, she looks up and says, “You think I’m just on TikTok or playing games. I’m actually in a research room talking to a water researcher from Botswana for a project.” “It’s laughable. You show it to the kids and they all laugh, right?” Miles says. Alarmed at the disconnect between how policymakers view tech in education and what teachers were seeing in the classroom, in 2017 Miles and his colleague Joe Clement, who teaches economics and government at the same school, published Screen Schooled, a book that argued that technology overuse is making kids dumber. In the years since, smartphones have been banned from their classrooms, but students still work from their laptops. “We had one kid tell us, and I think it was pretty insightful, ‘If you see me on my phone, there’s a 0% chance I’m doing something productive. If you see me on my laptop, there’s a 50% chance,’” Miles says. Until the pandemic, many teachers were “rightly sceptical” about the benefits of introducing more technology into the classroom, Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado, observes, but when lockdowns forced schools to go online, a new normal was created, and ed tech platforms such as Google Workspace for Education, Kahoot! and Zearn became ubiquitous. With the spread of generative AI came new promises that it could revolutionise education and usher in an era of personalised student learning, while also reducing the workload for teachers. But almost all the research that has found benefits to introducing tech in classrooms is funded by the ed-tech industry, and most large-scale independent research has found that screen time gets in the way of achievement. A global OECD study found, for instance, that the more students use tech in schools, the worse their results. “There is simply no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools … in essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children,” says Wayne Holmes, a professor of critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London. “Most sensible people would not go into a bar and meet somebody who says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this new drug. It’s really good for you’ – and just use it. Generally, we expect our medicines to be rigorously tested, we expect them to be prescribed to us by professionals. But suddenly when we’re talking about ed tech, which apparently is very beneficial for children’s developing brains, we don’t need to do that.” What worries Miles and Clement is not only that their students are permanently distracted by their devices, but that they will not develop critical thinking skills and deep knowledge when quick answers are only a click away. Where once Clement would ask his class a question such as, “Where do you think the US ranks in terms of GDP per capita?” and guide his students as they puzzled over the solution, now someone will have Googled the answer before he’s even finished his question. They know students use ChatGPT constantly and get annoyed if they aren’t provided with a digital copy of their assignment, because then they must type rather than copy and paste the relevant questions into an AI assistant or the Google search bar. “Being able to Google something and providing the right answer isn’t knowledge,” Clement says. “And having knowledge is incredibly important so that when you hear something that’s questionable or maybe fake, you think, ‘Wait a minute, that contradicts all the knowledge I have that says otherwise, right?’ It’s no wonder there’s a bunch of idiots walking about who think that the Earth is flat. Like, if you read a flat Earth blog, you think, ‘Ah, that makes a lot of sense’ because you don’t have any understanding or knowledge.” The internet is already awash with conspiracy and misinformation, something that will only become worse as AI hallucinates and produces plausible fakes, and he worries that young people are poorly equipped to navigate it. During the pandemic, Miles says, he found his young son weeping over his school-issued tablet. His son was doing an online maths program and he had been tasked with making six using the fewest number of one, three and five tokens. He kept suggesting using two threes, and the computer kept telling him he was wrong. Miles tried one and five, which the computer accepted. “That’s kind of the nightmare you get with a non-human AI, right?” Miles observes: students often approach topics in unanticipated and interesting ways, but machines struggle to cope with idiosyncrasy. Listening to his story, however, I was struck by a different kind of nightmare. Maybe the dawn of the new golden era of stupidity doesn’t begin when we submit to super-intelligent machines; it starts when we hand over power to dumb ones.\n",

The results? Those who let ChatGPT do the heavy lifting showed a measurable drop in the neural networks tied to attention, creativity and working memory. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could quote what they’d written,” she says, a fact that sent the study viral after she posted a pre‑review version on her lab’s page.\\n\\n**The flood of emails that followed was a sobering reminder of the “stupidogenic” society many scholars warn about.** Teachers from across the globe complained that students were turning the AI assistant into a crutch, producing “passable work” but losing the underlying knowledge. “We’re losing the ability to question, to doubt,” one teacher told the press, “and that’s where the flat‑earth blogs thrive.”\\n\\nThe research echoes a broader trend: the OECD’s Pisa scores for reading, maths and science peaked in 2012, after which they have plateaued or declined in many developed nations. Meanwhile, the “frictionless” user experience that keeps us scrolling, clicking and checking our phones has become a cultural norm. As Kosmyna notes, “Our brains love shortcuts, but they also need friction to learn.” The very design of our apps and AI tools eliminates that friction, turning us into passive users rather than active thinkers.\\n\\n**Not all hope is lost.** Some researchers, like Michael\\u202fGerlich from the Swiss Business School, argue that AI can amplify creativity if used properly. “The problem is the anchoring effect,” he says. “You ask a question, the AI gives an answer, and you’re less likely to explore alternatives.”\\n\\nFor the tech‑savvy 30‑year‑old who loves convenience but fears the cost of cognitive offloading, the lesson is clear: use AI to augment, not replace, the mental effort that makes us human. In the new era, the real question isn’t whether AI will make us smarter, but whether we’ll still remember to be skeptical.'}}\n",

            "        Parents will be able to block their children’s interactions with Meta’s AI character chatbots, as the tech company addresses concerns over inappropriate conversations. The social media company is adding new safeguards to its “teen accounts”, which are a default setting for under-18 users, by letting parents turn off their children’s chats with AI characters. These chatbots, which are created by users, are available on Facebook, Instagram and the Meta AI app. Parents will also be able to block specific AI characters if they don’t want to stop their children from interacting with chatbots altogether. They will also get “insights” into the topics their children are chatting about with AI characters, which Meta said would allow them to have “thoughtful” conversations with their children about AI interactions. “We recognise parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” said the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, and Alexander Wang, Meta’s chief AI officer, in a blog post. Meta said the changes would be rolled out early next year, initially to the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Instagram announced this week that it was adopting a version of the PG-13 cinema rating system to give parents stronger controls over their children’s use of the social media platform. As part of the tougher restrictions, its AI characters will not discuss self-harm, suicide or disordered eating with teenagers. Under-18s will only be able to discuss age-appropriate topics such as education and sport, Meta added, but would not be able to discuss romance or “other inappropriate content”. The changes follow reports that Meta’s chatbots were engaging in inappropriate conversations with under-18s. Reuters reported in August that Meta had permitted the bots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. Meta said it would revise the guidelines and such conversations with children never should have been allowed. In April, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) found that user-created chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors – or simulated the personae of minors. Meta described the WSJ’s testing as manipulative and unrepresentative of how most users engaged with AI companions, but made changes to its products afterwards, the WSJ reported. In one AI conversation reported by the WSJ, a chatbot using the voice of actor John Cena – one of several celebrities who signed deals to let Meta use their voices in the chatbots – told a user identifying as a 14-year-old girl: “I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” before referring to a graphic sexual scenario. WSJ reported that Cena’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment. WSJ also reported that chatbots called “Hottie Boy” and “Submissive Schoolgirl,” had attempted to steer conversations towards sexting.\n",

Research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna noticed colleagues relying heavily on generative AI like ChatGPT and felt their memories declined. She ran an EEG experiment, finding that participants who used ChatGPT showed significantly less activity in brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention, and creativity. Students often couldn't recall what they wrote. Kosmyna says brains love shortcuts, but need friction to learn. The frictionless user experience of modern tech encourages 'cognitive offloading,' making the real world feel harder. Experts call this a 'stupidogenic society.' Test scores like OECD's Pisa have been declining since 2012. Teachers worldwide are stressed, feeling students are producing passable work without usable knowledge. The article concludes that AI offers to outsource thinking itself, but the 'anchoring effect' means we stick to the first AI answer, hindering critical thinking and problem-solving. Educators worry this will churn out 'mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones.' The real nightmare may be handing power to dumb machines.\"\"\"\n",
